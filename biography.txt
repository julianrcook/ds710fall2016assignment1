Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.
1. What is your name?

Julian Cook

2. Why are you interested in Data Science?

I have always been interested in data, databases and machine learning. In the area that I work in, models only seem to ever explain about 70% of the cases, whereas machine learning algorithms seem especially adept at figuring out the remaining (messy and complex) 30% and do even better as you feed them more data. I am hoping to be able to show and prove that more problems can be directly solved using data science from the beginning, rather than at the margins of 'established' methodologies.
